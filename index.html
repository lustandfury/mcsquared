            1. Lean Discovery: Shifting from Outputs to Outcomes by Finding & Fixing Customer Pain
          </h3>
          <p class="f5 lh-copy mt0-ns">
            So many software development projects start with high levels of uncertainty. Some of it is explicit, you many not know exactly who the target customer is and what they want, and some of it may be implicit, you have a great idea but are uncertain about the technical risks of delivering the experience or what the state-of-the-art is capable of and, as they say, you don't know what you don't know. In these cases we echo the words of "Ike" Eisenhower:
            <blockquote class="fw6">“Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.”
              <br>
              <caption>

          2. What Is Innovation — Really?
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy mt0-ns">Innovation is one of the ultimate buzzwords of our era but what is it really? What is its meaning? How can we see it? Replicate it? Scale it? In his talk, I propose that innovation really is the “removal of friction” from a system; and that through this lens we can understand the rise of design, lean startup, Silicon Valley and possibly many other innovative happenings across time.
        </p>
        <h4>
          The talk covers the following topics:

          3. How Steve Jobs REALLY helped Apple get back to basics
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy mt0-ns">
          “A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.” is an often quoted piece of Steve Jobs wisdom I’ve hated for a long time. It has given license to so much misguided energy, and I’ve seen too many companies use it’s premise to avoid talking to customers many times in my career. I want to dispel the implication of this statement once and for all.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 lh-copy mt0-ns">
          The sentence before the quote illuminates things further and changes the intent considerably (That full response is even longer and you can read the full interview here):
          <blockquote class="fw6">
            “…it’s really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don’t know what they want until you show it to them.”
            <br>
